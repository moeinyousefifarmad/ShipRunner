<p>This is my first project on github . For the first project I decided to make a game based on the <strong>LD34</strong> theme. <strong>Ship runner</strong> is a 2d platformer and runner game with pixel art style . <br>
Theme : LD34 - <strong>two buttons control</strong></p>
This is a solo project . everything , from programming to art is on me.<br>
I use <strong>Unity</strong> as game engine.<br>
<strong>aseprite</strong> for 2d pixel art.
